# Indo Club 

Welcome to the official website of *Indo Club*, a fictional yet fiery football team made to showcase player profiles, formations, and club vibes — all wrapped in a slick dark theme.

This project brings together clean HTML structure, responsive layouts, animated interactions, and a pure CSS-rendered football pitch to highlight team strategy and talent in a dynamic, modern way.

## What’s Inside

- **Main Players** — Our current stars. Youth, speed, skill — it’s all here.
- **Veteran Players** — The legends. Experience, control, class.
- **Future Talents** — The next generation. Watch this space.
- **Formation Page** — Tactics drawn on a custom CSS football field with real formation logic and player positioning.

Each section lives on its own dedicated page, and transitions are seamless. No frameworks, no fuss — just HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript.

## Key Features

- Responsive design that looks great on all devices
- Dark-themed UI with gradient backgrounds and active nav highlighting
- Hover effects that spotlight individual player cards with zoom + page blur

  - Main: `4-3-3`

  - Defensive: `5-3-2`, `4-2-3-1`  
  - Balanced: `4-4-2`, `4-2-2-2`  
- Player cards styled like jersey tags, showing name, number, and position

## A Few Notes

This was a personal project to sharpen frontend skills while combining it with something I love — football. The CSS pitch was the most challenging and fun part. Lining up players by position, mimicking real tactics, and maintaining responsiveness took some time but was totally worth it.

If you're into clean frontend work, minimalism, or football-centric UIs, take a look around or fork it and tweak it however you like.

## Things I Might Add Next

- Player filters (by position, age, etc.)
- Interactive squad builder
- Match results & news section
- Admin panel with editable player cards (maybe with localStorage or Firebase)
